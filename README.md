Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

**`cibuildwheel` is in beta**. It's brand new - I'd love for you to try it and help make it better!

- Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows (32 and 64bit) wheels using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` currently works on **Travis CI** and **Azure Pipelines** to build wheels for all three supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). On **CircleCI** Linux and macOS wheels can be built, and on **AppVeyor** Windows is supported.

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| Travis CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| AppVeyor        |       |       | ✅      |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         |

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. It will try to install packages globally; this is no good. Travis CI, CircleCI, and AppVeyor run their builds in isolated environments, so are ideal for this kind of script.

### Minimal setup

- To build Linux and Mac wheels on Travis CI, create a `.travis.yml` file in your repo.

    ```yaml
    language: python
    
    matrix:
      include:
        - sudo: required
          services:
            - docker
          env: PIP=pip
        - os: osx
          language: generic
          env: PIP=pip2

    script:
      - $PIP install cibuildwheel==0.12.0
      - cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
    ```

  To build on Windows too, add this matrix entry: 
  ```yaml
    - os: windows
      language: shell
      before_install:
       - choco install python3 --version 3.6.8 --no-progress -y
      env:
       - PATH=/c/Python36:/c/Python36/Scripts:$PATH
  ```

  Note that building Windows Python 2.7 wheels on Travis is unsupported.

  Then setup a deployment method by following the [Travis CI deployment docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/), or see [Delivering to PyPI](#delivering-to-pypi) below.

- To build Windows wheels on AppVeyor, create an `appveyor.yml` file in your repo.

    ```
    build_script:
      - ps: |
          $PYTHON = $env:PYTHON
          curl -o install_python.ps1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthew-brett/multibuild/11a389d78892cf90addac8f69433d5e22bfa422a/install_python.ps1

          & { $env:PYTHON = 'C:\\Python38-x64'; .\install_python.ps1 }
          $env:PYTHON = $PYTHON
      - pip install cibuildwheel==0.12.0
      - cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
    artifacts:
      - path: "wheelhouse\\*.whl"
        name: Wheels
    ```
    
  AppVeyor will store the built wheels for you - you can access them from the project console. Alternatively, you may want to store them in the same place as the Travis CI build. See [AppVeyor deployment docs](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/) for more info, or see [Delivering to PyPI](#delivering-to-pypi) below.
    
</details>

- Commit those files, enable building of your repo on Travis CI and AppVeyor, and push.

All being well, you should get wheels delivered to you in a few minutes.

A more detailed description of the options, the allowed values, and some examples can be found in the [Options](#options) section.

### Linux builds on Docker

Linux wheels are built in the [`manylinux` docker images](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) to provide binary compatible wheels on Linux, according to [PEP 571](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/). Because of this, when building with `cibuildwheel` on Linux, a few things should be taken into account:
- Programs and libraries cannot be installed on the Travis CI Ubuntu host with `apt-get`, but can be installed inside of the Docker image using `yum` or manually. The same goes for environment variables that are potentially needed to customize the wheel building. `cibuildwheel` supports this by providing the `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` and `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` options to setup the build environment inside the running Docker image. See [below](#options) for details on these options.
- The project directory is mounted in the running Docker instance as `/project`, the output directory for the wheels as `/output`. In general, this is handled transparently by `cibuildwheel`. For a more finegrained level of control however, the root of the host file system is mounted as `/host`, allowing for example to access shared files, caches, etc. on the host file system.  Note that this is not available on CircleCI due to their Docker policies.
- Alternative dockers images can be specified with the `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE` and `CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE` options to allow for a custom, preconfigured build environment for the Linux builds. See [below](#options) for more details.


Options
-------

```
usage: cibuildwheel [-h] [--platform {auto,linux,macos,windows}]
                    [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--print-build-identifiers]
                    [project_dir]
    
Build wheels for all the platforms.

positional arguments:
  project_dir           Path to the project that you want wheels for.
                        Default: the current directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --platform {auto,linux,macos,windows}
                        Platform to build for. For "linux" you need docker
                        running, on Mac or Linux. For "macos", you need a Mac
                        machine, and note that this script is going to
                        automatically install MacPython on your system, so
                        don't run on your development machine. For "windows",
                        you need to run in Windows, and it will build and test
                        for all versions of Python at C:\PythonXX[-x64].
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Destination folder for the wheels.
  --print-build-identifiers
                        Print the build identifiers matched by the current
                        invocation and exit.

```

Most of the config is via environment variables. These go into `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml`, and `.circleci/config.yml` nicely.

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_PLATFORM` | Command line argument: `--platform`
| --- | ---

Options: `auto` `linux` `macos` `windows`

Default: `auto`

`auto` will auto-detect platform using environment variables, such as `TRAVIS_OS_NAME`/`APPVEYOR`/`CIRCLECI`.

For `linux` you need Docker running, on Mac or Linux. For `macos`, you need a Mac machine, and note that this script is going to automatically install MacPython on your system, so don't run on your development machine. For `windows`, you need to run in Windows, and it will build and test for all versions of Python at `C:\PythonXX[-x64]`.

***

| Environment variables: `CIBW_BUILD` and `CIBW_SKIP`
| ---

Optional.

Space-separated list of builds to build and skip. Each build has an identifier like `cp27-manylinux_x86_64` or `cp34-macosx_10_6_intel` - you can list specific ones to build and `cibuildwheel` will only build those, and/or list ones to skip and `cibuildwheel` won't try to build them.

When both options are specified, both conditions are applied and only builds with a tag that matches `CIBW_BUILD` and does not match `CIBW_SKIP` will be built.

The format is `python_tag-platform_tag`. The tags are similar but not identical to the ones defined in [PEP 425](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/#details).

Python tags look like `cp27` `cp34` `cp35` `cp36` `cp37` `cp38`

Platform tags look like `macosx_10_6_intel` `manylinux_x86_64` `manylinux_i686` `win32` `win_amd64`

You can also use shell-style globbing syntax (as per `fnmatch`).

The list of supported and currently selected build identifiers can be retrieved by passing the `--print-build-identifiers` flag to `cibuildwheel`.

Examples:
- Only build on Python 3.6: `CIBW_BUILD`:`cp36-*`
- Skip building on Python 2.7 on the Mac: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp27-macosx_10_6_intel`
- Skip building on Python 2.7 on all platforms: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp27-*`
- Skip Python 2.7 on Windows: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp27-win*`
- Skip Python 2.7 on 32-bit Windows: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp27-win32`
- Skip Python 3.4 and Python 3.5: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp34-* cp35-*`
- Skip Python 3.6 on Linux: `CIBW_SKIP`:`cp36-manylinux*`
- Only build on Python 3 and skip 32-bit builds: `CIBW_BUILD`:`cp3?-*` and `CIBW_SKIP`:`*-win32 *-manylinux_i686`

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY`
| ---

Optional.

An number from 1 to 3 to increase the level of verbosity (corresponding to invoking pip with `-v`, `-vv`, and `-vvv`), between -1 and -3 (`-q`, `-qq`, and `-qqq`), or just 0 (default verbosity). These flags are useful while debugging a build when the output of the actual build invoked by `pip wheel` is required.

Platform-specific variants also available:
`CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_MACOS` | `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_LINUX`

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT`
| ---

Optional.

A space-separated list of environment variables to set during the build. Bash syntax should be used (even on Windows!).

You must set this variable to pass variables to Linux builds (since they execute in a Docker container). It also works for the other platforms.

You can use `$PATH` syntax to insert other variables, or the `$(pwd)` syntax to insert the output of other shell commands.

Example: `CFLAGS="-g -Wall" CXXFLAGS="-Wall"`  
Example: `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin`  
Example: `BUILD_TIME="$(date)"`  
Example: `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="https://pypi.myorg.com/simple"`  

Platform-specific variants also available:
`CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_MACOS` | `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX`

In addition to the above, `cibuildwheel` always defines the environment variable `CIBUILDWHEEL=1`. This can be useful for [building wheels with optional extensions](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/wiki/Building-packages-with-optional-C-extensions).

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD`
| ---

Optional.

A shell command to run before building the wheel. This option allows you to run a command in **each** Python environment before the `pip wheel` command. This is useful if you need to set up some dependency so it's available during the build.

If dependencies are required to build your wheel (for example if you include a header from a Python module), set this to `pip install .`, and the dependencies will be installed automatically by pip. However, this means your package will be built twice - if your package takes a long time to build, you might wish to manually list the dependencies here instead.

The active Python binary can be accessed using `python`, and pip with `pip`; `cibuildwheel` makes sure the right version of Python and pip will be executed. `{project}` can be used as a placeholder for the absolute path to the project's root.

Example: `pip install .`  
Example: `pip install pybind11`  
Example: `yum install -y libffi-dev && pip install .`

Platform-specific variants also available:  
 `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_MACOS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_LINUX`

***

| Environment variables: `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE` and `CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE`
| ---

Optional.

An alternative Docker image to be used for building [`manylinux`](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) wheels. `cibuildwheel` will then pull these instead of the default images, [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64) and [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_i686`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_i686).

The value of this option can either be set to `manylinux1` or `manylinux2010` to use the [official `manylinux` images](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux), or any other valid Docker image name.

Beware to specify a valid Docker image that can be used in the same way as the official, default Docker images: all necessary Python and pip versions need to be present in `/opt/python/`, and the `auditwheel` tool needs to be present for `cibuildwheel` to work. Apart from that, the architecture and relevant shared system libraries need to be manylinux1- or manylinux2010-compatible in order to produce valid `manylinux1`/`manylinux2010` wheels (see https://github.com/pypa/manylinux, [PEP 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/), and [PEP 571](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/) for more details).

Note that `auditwheel` detects the version of the `manylinux` standard in the Docker image through the `AUDITWHEEL_PLAT` environment variable, as `cibuildwheel` has no way of detecting the correct `--plat` command line argument to pass to `auditwheel` for a custom image. If a Docker image does not correctly set this `AUDITWHEEL_PLAT` environment variable, the `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` option can be used to do so (e.g., `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT="manylinux2010_$(uname -m)"`).

Example: `manylinux1`  
Example: `dockcross/manylinux-x64`  
Example: `dockcross/manylinux-x86`

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`
| ---

Optional.

Shell command to run tests after the build. The wheel will be installed automatically and available for import from the tests. `{project}` can be used as a placeholder for the absolute path to the project's root and will be replaced by `cibuildwheel`.

On Linux and Mac, the command runs in a shell, so you can write things like `cmd1 && cmd2`. 

Example: `nosetests {project}/tests`

Platform-specific variants also available:
`CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_LINUX`

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES`
| ---

Optional.

Space-separated list of dependencies required for running the tests.

Example: `pytest`  
Example: `nose==1.3.7 moto==0.4.31`

Platform-specific variants also available:
`CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_LINUX`

***

| Environment variable: `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS`
| ---

Optional.

Comma-separated list of
[extras_require](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies)
options that should be included when installing the wheel prior to running the
tests. This can be used to avoid having to redefine test dependencies in
`CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES` if they are already defined in `setup.py` or
`setup.cfg`.

Example: `test,qt` (will cause the wheel to be installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`)


Platform-specific variants also available:
`CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_LINUX`

Delivering to PyPI
------------------

After you've built your wheels, you'll probably want to deliver them to PyPI.

### Manual method

On your development machine, do the following...

```bash
# Clear out your 'dist' folder. 
rm -rf dist
# Make a source distribution

### Semi-automatic method using wheelhouse-uploader

Obviously, manual steps are for chumps, so we can automate this a little by using [wheelhouse-uploader](https://github.com/ogrisel/wheelhouse-uploader).

> Quick note from me - using S3 as a storage didn't work due to a [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-792) in libcloud. Feel free to use my fork of that package that fixes the bug `pip install https://github.com/joerick/libcloud/archive/v1.5.0-s3fix.zip`

### Automatic method

If you don't need much control over the release of a package, you can set up cibuildwheel to deliver the wheels straight to PyPI. This doesn't require any cloud storage to work - you just need to bump the version and tag it.

Check out [this example repo](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel-autopypi-example) for instructions on how to set this up.

It didn't work!
---------------

If your wheel didn't compile, check the list below for some debugging tips.

- A mistake in your config. To quickly test your config without doing a git push and waiting for your code to build on CI, you can run the Linux build in a Docker container. On Mac or Linux, with Docker running, try `cibuildwheel --platform linux`. You'll have to bring your config into the current environment first.
- Missing dependency. You might need to install something on the build machine. You can do this in `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml`, or `.circleci/config.yml`, with apt-get, brew or whatever Windows uses :P . Given how the Linux build works, we'll probably have to build something into `cibuildwheel`. Let's chat about that over in the issues!
- Windows: missing C feature. The Windows C compiler doesn't support C language features invented after 1990, so you'll have to backport your C code to C90. For me, this mostly involved putting my variable declarations at the top of the function like an animal.
- MacOS: calling cibuildwheel from a python3 script and getting a `ModuleNotFoundError`? Due to a [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue22490) in CPython, you'll need to [unset the `__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__` variable](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/issues/133#issuecomment-478288597) before activating a venv.

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` runs the wheel through delocate or auditwheel, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine. 

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Contributing
============

Wheel-building is pretty complex. I expect users to find many edge-cases - please help the rest of the community out by documenting these, adding features to support them, and reporting bugs.

I plan to be pretty liberal in accepting pull requests, as long as they align with the design goals below.

`cibuildwheel` is indie open source. I'm not paid to work on this.

Design Goals
------------

- `cibuildwheel` should wrap the complexity of wheel building.
- The user interface to `cibuildwheel` is the build script (e.g. `.travis.yml`). Feature additions should not increase the complexity of this script.
- Options should be environment variables (these lend themselves better to YML config files). They should be prefixed with `CIBW_`.
- Options should be generalise to all platforms. If platform-specific options are required, they should be namespaced e.g. `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_MACOS`

Other notes:

- The platforms are very similar, until they're not. I'd rather have straight-forward code than totally DRY code, so let's keep airy platfrom abstractions to a minimum.
- I might want to break the options into a shared config file one day, so that config is more easily shared. That has motivated some of the design decisions.

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

If `cibuildwheel` is too limited for your needs, consider [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It can do a lot more than this project - it's used to build SciPy!
