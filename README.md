<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

While cibuildwheel itself requires a recent Python version to run (we support the last three releases), it can target the following versions to build wheels:

|                    | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | Windows Arm64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x | manylinux<br/>musllinux armv7l | Android | iOS | Pyodide |

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in on 3.13 using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+ (10.13+ for Python 3.12+), and Windows wheels for CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM | Android | iOS |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             | ✅⁴      |     |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      |      |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Requires a macOS runner; runs tests on the simulator for the runner's architecture.</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Building for Android requires the runner to be Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64 or macOS x86_64. Testing has [additional requirements](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/platforms/#android).</sup><br>
<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

<!--generic-github-start-->
```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, windows-11-arm, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.1.2

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```
<!--generic-github-end-->

For more information, including PyPI deployment, and the use of other CI services or the dedicated GitHub Action, check out the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io) and the [examples](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/tree/main/examples).

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!-- [[[cog from readme_changelog import mini_changelog; print(mini_changelog()) ]]] -->

### v3.1.2

_29 July 2025_

- ⚠️  Add an error if `CIBW_FREE_THREADING_SUPPORT` is set; you are likely missing 3.13t wheels, please use the `enable`/`CIBW_ENABLE` (#2520)
- 🛠 `riscv64` now enabled if you target that architecture, it's now supported on PyPI (#2509)
- 🛠 Add warning when using `cpython-experimental-riscv64` (no longer needed) (#2526, #2528)
- 🛠 iOS versions bumped, fixing issues with 3.14 (now RC 1) (#2530)
- 🐛 Fix bug in Android running wheel from our GitHub Action (#2517)
- 🐛 Fix warning when using `test-skip` of `"*-macosx_universal2:arm64"` (#2522)
- 🐛 Fix incorrect number of wheels reported in logs, again (#2517)
- 📚 We welcome our Android platform maintainer (#2516)


### v3.1.1

_24 July 2025_

- 🐛 Fix a bug showing an incorrect wheel count at the end of execution, and misrepresenting test-only runs in the GitHub Action summary (#2512)
- 📚 Docs fix (#2510)

### v3.1.0

_23 July 2025_


- 🌟 CPython 3.14 wheels are now built by default - without the `"cpython-prerelease"` `enable` set. It's time to build and upload these wheels to PyPI! This release includes CPython 3.14.0rc1, which is guaranteed to be ABI compatible with the final release. (#2507) Free-threading is no longer experimental in 3.14, so you have to skip it explicitly with `'cp31?t-*'` if you don't support it yet. (#2503)
- 🌟 Adds the ability to [build wheels for Android](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/platforms/#android)! Set the [`platform` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#platform) to `android` on Linux or macOS to try it out! (#2349)
- 🌟 Adds Pyodide 0.28, which builds 3.13 wheels (#2487)
- ✨ Support for 32-bit `manylinux_2_28` (now a consistent default) and `manylinux_2_34` added (#2500)
- 🛠 Improved summary, will also use markdown summary output on GHA (#2469)
- 🛠 The riscv64 images now have a working default (as they are now part of pypy/manylinux), but are still experimental (and behind an `enable`) since you can't push them to PyPI yet (#2506)
- 🛠 Fixed a typo in the 3.9 MUSL riscv64 identifier (`cp39-musllinux_ricv64` -> `cp39-musllinux_riscv64`) (#2490)
- 🛠 Mistyping `--only` now shows the correct possibilities, and even suggests near matches on Python 3.14+ (#2499)
- 🛠 Only support one output from the repair step on linux like other platforms; auditwheel fixed this over four years ago! (#2478)
- 🛠 We now use pattern matching extensively (#2434)
- 📚 We now have platform maintainers for our special platforms and interpreters! (#2481)



### v3.0.1

_5 July 2025_

- 🛠 Updates CPython 3.14 prerelease to 3.14.0b3 (#2471)
- ✨ Adds a CPython 3.14 prerelease iOS build (only when prerelease builds are [enabled](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable)) (#2475)

### v3.0.0

_11 June 2025_

See @henryiii's [release post](https://iscinumpy.dev/post/cibuildwheel-3-0-0/) for more info on new features!

- 🌟 Adds the ability to [build wheels for iOS](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/platforms/#ios)! Set the [`platform` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#platform) to `ios` on a Mac with the iOS toolchain to try it out! (#2286, #2363, #2432)
- 🌟 Adds support for the GraalPy interpreter! Enable for your project using the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable). (#1538, #2411, #2414)
- ✨ Adds CPython 3.14 support, under the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable) `cpython-prerelease`. This version of cibuildwheel uses 3.14.0b2. (#2390)

    _While CPython is in beta, the ABI can change, so your wheels might not be compatible with the final release. For this reason, we don't recommend distributing wheels until RC1, at which point 3.14 will be available in cibuildwheel without the flag._ (#2390)

- ✨ Adds the [test-sources option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#test-sources), which copies files and folders into the temporary working directory we run tests from. (#2062, #2284, #2420, #2437)

    This is particularly important for iOS builds, which do not support placeholders in the `test-command`, but can also be useful for other platforms.

- ✨ Adds [`dependency-versions`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#dependency-versions) inline syntax (#2122)
- ✨ Improves support for Pyodide builds and adds the experimental [`pyodide-version`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#pyodide-version) option, which allows you to specify the version of Pyodide to use for builds. (#2002)
- ✨ Add `pyodide-prerelease` [enable](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable) option, with an early build of 0.28 (Python 3.13). (#2431)
- ✨ Adds the [`test-environment`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#test-environment) option, which allows you to set environment variables for the test command. (#2388)
- ✨ Adds the [`xbuild-tools`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#xbuild-tools) option, which allows you to specify tools safe for cross-compilation. Currently only used on iOS; will be useful for Android in the future. (#2317)
- 🛠 The default [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#linux-image) has changed from `manylinux2014` to `manylinux_2_28`. (#2330)
- 🛠 EOL images `manylinux1`, `manylinux2010`, `manylinux_2_24` and `musllinux_1_1` can no longer be specified by their shortname. The full OCI name can still be used for these images, if you wish. (#2316)
- 🛠 Invokes `build` rather than `pip wheel` to build wheels by default. You can control this via the [`build-frontend`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#build-frontend) option. You might notice that you can see your build log output now! (#2321)
- 🛠 Build verbosity settings have been reworked to have consistent meanings between build backends when non-zero. (#2339)
- 🛠 Removed the `CIBW_PRERELEASE_PYTHONS` and `CIBW_FREE_THREADED_SUPPORT` options - these have been folded into the [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable) option instead. (#2095)
- 🛠 Build environments no longer have setuptools and wheel preinstalled. (#2329)
- 🛠 Use the standard Schema line for the integrated JSONSchema. (#2433)
- ⚠️ Dropped support for building Python 3.6 and 3.7 wheels. If you need to build wheels for these versions, use cibuildwheel v2.23.3 or earlier. (#2282)
- ⚠️ The minimum Python version required to run cibuildwheel is now Python 3.11. You can still build wheels for Python 3.8 and newer. (#1912)
- ⚠️ 32-bit Linux wheels no longer built by default - the [arch](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#archs) was removed from `"auto"`. It now requires explicit `"auto32"`. Note that modern manylinux images (like the new default, `manylinux_2_28`) do not have 32-bit versions. (#2458)
- ⚠️ PyPy wheels no longer built by default, due to a change to our options system. To continue building PyPy wheels, you'll now need to set the [`enable` option](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable) to `pypy` or `pypy-eol`. (#2095)
- ⚠️ Dropped official support for Appveyor. If it was working for you before, it will probably continue to do so, but we can't be sure, because our CI doesn't run there anymore. (#2386)
- 📚 A reorganisation of the docs, and numerous updates. (#2280)
- 📚 Use Python 3.14 color output in docs CLI output. (#2407)
- 📚 Docs now primarily use the pyproject.toml name of options, rather than the environment variable name. (#2389)
- 📚 README table now matches docs and auto-updates. (#2427, #2428)

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.

If you are building Rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make GLIBC work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with Rust. See [maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building Rust wheels and cross-compiling.
