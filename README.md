<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

|   | macOS x86_64 | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | manylinux x86_64 | manylinux i686 | manylinux aarch64 | manylinux ppc64le | manylinux s390x |

<sup>¹ Not supported on Travis</sup><br>
<sup>² Only supported on Travis</sup><br>
<sup>³ Beta support until Travis CI fixes <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/no-space-left-on-device-for-system-z/5954/11">a bug</a></sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` currently works on **Travis CI**, **Azure Pipelines**, **AppVeyor**, **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, and **Gitlab CI**. Check the table below for supported platforms on each service:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✴️¹           |
| Travis CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅           |
| AppVeyor        | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |              |
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✴️¹           |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         |              |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    |       |         |              |

<sup>¹ Requires a "third-party build host"; expected to work with cibuildwheel but not directly tested by our CI.</sup><br>

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. Because it uses system Python from Python.org it will try to install packages globally - not what you expect from a build tool! Instead, isolated CI services like those mentioned above are ideal.

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on Github Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macOS-10.15]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        name: Install Python

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.7.2

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        env:
          CIBW_SKIP: "cp27-* pp27-*"  # skip Python 2.7 wheels

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

For more information, including building on Python 2, PyPI deployment, and the use of other CI services like Travis CI, Appveyor, Azure Pipelines, or CircleCI, check out the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.org) and the [examples](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/tree/master/examples).

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!--changelog-start-->

### 1.5.1

_25 June 2020_

- 🐛 Fix "OSError: [WinError 17] The system cannot move the file to a different
  disk drive" on Github Actions (#388, #389)

### 1.5.0

_24 June 2020_

- 🌟 Add [`CIBW_BEFORE_ALL`](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#before-all)
  option, which lets you run a command on the build machine before any wheels
  are built. This is especially useful when building on Linux, to `make`
  something external to Python, or to `yum install` a dependency. (#342)
- ✨ Added support for projects using pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
  (#360, #358)
- ✨ Added workaround to allow Python 3.5 on Windows to pull dependencies from
  pyproject.toml. (#358)
- 📚 Improved Github Actions examples and docs (#354, #362)
- 🐛 Ensure pip wheel uses the specified package, and doesn't build a wheel
  from PyPI (#369)
- 🛠 Internal changes: using pathlib.Path, precommit hooks, testing
  improvements.

### 1.4.2

_25 May 2020_

- 🛠 Dependency updates, including CPython 3.8.3 & manylinux images.
- 🛠 Lots of internal updates - type annotations and checking using mypy, and
  a new integration testing system.
- ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel using Python 3.5. cibuildwheel
  will continue to build Python 3.5 wheels until EOL.

### 1.4.1

_4 May 2020_

- 🐛 Fix a bug causing programs running inside the i686 manylinux images to
  think they were running x86_64 and target the wrong architecture. (#336,
  #338)

### 1.4.0

_2 May 2020_

- 🌟 Deterministic builds. cibuildwheel now locks the versions of the tools it
  uses. This means that pinning your version of cibuildwheel pins the versions
  of pip, setuptools, manylinux etc. that are used under the hood. This should
  make things more reliable. But note that we don't control the entire build
  environment on macOS and Windows, where the version of Xcode and Visual
  Studio can still effect things.

  This can be controlled using the [CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#dependency-versions)
  and [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image)
  options - if you always want to use the latest toolchain, you can still do
  that, or you can specify your own pip constraints file and manylinux image.
  (#256)
- ✨ Added `package_dir` command line option, meaning we now support building
  a package that lives in a subdirectory and pulls in files from the wider
  project. See [the `package_dir` option help](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#command-line-options)
  for more information.

  Note that this change makes the working directory (where you call
  cibuildwheel from) relevant on Linux, as it's considered the 'project' and
  will be copied into the Docker container. If your builds are slower on this
  version, that's likely the reason. `cd` to your project and then call
  `cibuildwheel` from there. (#319, #295)
- 🛠 On macOS, we make `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` default to `10.9` if it's
  not set. This should make things more consistent between Python versions.
- 🛠 Dependency updates - CPython 3.7.7, CPython 2.7.18, Pypy 7.3.1.

### 1.3.0

_12 March 2020_

- 🌟 Add support for building on Github Actions! Check out the
  [docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/#github-actions)
  for information on how to set it up. (#194)
- ✨ Add the `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST` option, which lets you run a command to
  prepare the environment before your tests are run. (#242)

### 1.2.0

_8 March 2020_

- 🌟 Add support for building PyPy wheels, across Manylinux, macOS, and
  Windows. (#185)
- 🌟 Added the ability to build ARM64 (aarch64), ppc64le, and s390x wheels,
  using manylinux2014 and Travis CI. (#273)
- ✨ You can now build macOS wheels on Appveyor. (#230)
- 🛠 Changed default macOS minimum target to 10.9, from 10.6. This allows the
  use of more modern C++ libraries, among other things. (#156)
- 🛠 Stop building universal binaries on macOS. We now only build x86_64
  wheels on macOS. (#220)
- ✨ Allow chaining of commands using `&&` and `||` on Windows inside
  CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD and CIBW_TEST_COMMAND. (#293)
- 🛠 Improved error reporting for failed Cython builds due to stale .so files
  (#263)
- 🛠 Update CPython from 3.7.5 to 3.7.6 and from 3.8.0 to 3.8.2 on Mac/Windows
- 🛠 Improved error messages when a bad config breaks cibuildwheel's PATH
  variable. (#264)
- ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel on Python 2.7. cibuildwheel
  will continue to build Python 2.7 wheels for a little while. (#265)

### 1.1.0

_7 December 2019_

- 🌟 Add support for building manylinux2014 wheels. To use, set
  `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE` and CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE to
  `manylinux2014`.
- ✨ Add support for [Linux on Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2018/03/06/appveyor-for-linux/) (#204, #207)
- ✨ Add `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND` env variable, for changing how
  `auditwheel` or `delocate` are invoked, or testing an equivalent on
  Windows. (#211)
- 📚 Added some travis example configs - these are available in /examples. (#228)

### 1.0.0

_10 November 2019_

- 🌟 Add support for building Python 3.8 wheels! (#180)
- 🌟 Add support for building manylinux2010 wheels. cibuildwheel will now
  build using the manylinux2010 images by default. If your project is still
  manylinux1 compatible, you should get both manylinux1 and manylinux2010
  wheels - you can upload both to PyPI. If you always require manylinux1 wheels, you can
  build using the old manylinux1 image using the [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image) option.
  (#155)
- 📚 Documentation is now on its [own mini-site](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io),
   rather than on the README (#169)
- ✨ Add support for building Windows wheels on Travis CI. (#160)
- 🛠 If you set `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`, your tests now run in a virtualenv. (#164)
- 🛠 Windows now uses Python as installed by nuget, rather than the versions
  installed by the various CI providers. (#180)
- 🛠 Update Python from 2.7.16 to 2.7.17 and 3.7.4 to 3.7.5 on macOS (#171)
- ⚠️ Removed support for Python 3.4 (#168)

### 0.12.0

_29 September 2019_

- ✨ Add CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS option, to allow testing using extra_require
  options. For example, set `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS=test,qt` to make the wheel
  installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`
- 🛠 Update Python from 3.7.2 to 3.7.4 on macOS
- 🛠 Update OpenSSL patch to 1.0.2t on macOS

### 0.11.1

_28 May 2019_

- 🐛 Fix missing file in the release tarball, that was causing problems with
  Windows builds (#141)

### 0.11.0

_26 May 2019_

- 🌟 Add support for building on Azure pipelines! This lets you build all
  Linux, Mac and Windows wheels on one service, so it promises to be the
  easiest to set up! Check out the quickstart in the docs, or
  [cibuildwheel-azure-example](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel-azure-example)
  for an example project. (#126, #132)
- 🛠 Internal change - the end-to-end test projects format was updated, so we
  can more precisely assert what should be produced for each one. (#136, #137).

### 0.10.2

_10 March 2019_

- 🛠 Revert temporary fix in macOS, that was working around a bug in pip 19 (#129)

- 🐛 Fixed a bug where cibuildwheel would download and build a package from PyPI(!) instead of building the package on the local machine. (#51)

### 0.6.0

_9 October 2017_

- ✨ On the Linux build, the host filesystem is now accessible via `/host` (#36)

### 0.4.0

_23 July 2017_

- 🐛 Fixed a bug that was increasing the build time by building the wheel twice. This was a problem for large projects that have a long build time. If you're upgrading and you need the old behaviour, use `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD={pip} install .`, or install exactly the dependencies you need in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD`. See #18.

### 0.3.0

_27 June 2017_

- ⚠️ Removed Python 2.6 support on Linux (#12)

### 0.2.1

_11 June 2017_

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.
