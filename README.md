<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

While cibuildwheel itself requires a recent Python version to run (we support the last three releases), it can target the following versions to build wheels:

|                | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | Windows Arm64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x | musllinux armv7l | Pyodide |

<sup>¹ PyPy is only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in using [`CIBW_FREE_THREADED_SUPPORT`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#free-threaded-support).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+ (10.13+ for Python 3.12+), and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅¹       | ✅        | ✅²         |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             |
| AppVeyor        | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |           | ✅        | ✅²         |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup>

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==2.21.3

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

For more information, including PyPI deployment, and the use of other CI services or the dedicated GitHub Action, check out the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io) and the [examples](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/tree/main/examples).

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!-- START bin/update_readme_changelog.py -->

<!-- this section was generated by bin/update_readme_changelog.py -- do not edit manually -->

### v2.21.3

_9 October 2024_

- 🛠 Update CPython 3.13 to 3.13.0 final release (#2032)
- 📚 Docs updates and tidy ups (#2035)

### v2.21.2

_2 October 2024_

- ✨ Adds support for building 32-bit armv7l wheels on musllinux. On a Linux system with emulation set up, set [CIBW_ARCHS](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#archs) to `armv7l` on Linux to try it out if you're interested! (#2017)
- 🐛 Fix Linux Podman builds on some systems (#2016)
- ✨ Adds official support for running on Python 3.13 (#2026)
- 🛠 Update CPython 3.13 to 3.13.0rc3 (#2029)

Note: the default [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#linux-image) is **scheduled to change** from `manylinux2014` to `manylinux_2_28` in a cibuildwheel release on or after **6th May 2025** - you can set the value now to avoid getting upgraded if you want. (#1992)

### v2.21.1

_16 September 2024_

- 🐛 Fix a bug in the Linux build, where files copied to the container would have invalid ownership permissions (#2007)
- 🐛 Fix a bug on Windows where cibuildwheel would call upon `uv` to install dependencies for versions of CPython that it does not support (#2005)
- 🐛 Fix a bug where `uv 0.4.10` would not use the right Python when testing on Linux. (#2008)
- 🛠 Bump our documentation pins, fixes an issue with a missing package (#2011)

### v2.21.0

_13 September 2024_

- ⚠️ Update CPython 3.12 to 3.12.6, which changes the macOS minimum deployment target on CPython 3.12 from macOS 10.9 to macOS 10.13 (#1998)
- 🛠 Changes the behaviour when inheriting `config-settings` in TOML overrides - rather than extending each key, which is rarely useful, individual keys will override previously set values. (#1803)
- 🛠 Update CPython 3.13 to 3.13.0rc2 (#1998)
- ✨ Adds support for multiarch OCI images (#1961)
- 🐛 Fixes some bugs building Linux wheels on macOS. (#1961)
- ⚠️ Changes the minimum version of Docker/Podman to Docker API version 1.43, Podman API version 3. The only mainstream runner this should affect is Travis Graviton2 runners - if so you can [upgrade your version of Docker](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/1961#issuecomment-2304060019). (#1961)


### v2.20.0

_4 August 2024_

- 🌟 CPython 3.13 wheels are now built by default - without the `CIBW_PRERELEASE_PYTHONS` flag. It's time to build and upload these wheels to PyPI! This release includes CPython 3.13.0rc1, which is guaranteed to be ABI compatible with the final release. Free-threading is still behind a flag/config option. (#1950)
- ✨ Provide a `CIBW_ALLOW_EMPTY` environment variable as an alternative to the command line flag. (#1937)
- 🐛 Don't use uv on PyPy3.8 on Windows, it stopped working starting in 0.2.25. Note that PyPy 3.8 is EoL. (#1868)
- 🛠 Set the `VSCMD_ARG_TGT_ARCH` variable based on target arch. (#1876)
- 🛠 Undo cleaner output on pytest 8-8.2 now that 8.3 is out. (#1943)
- 📚 Update examples to use Python 3.12 on host  (cibuildwheel will require Python 3.11+ on the host machine starting in October 2024) (#1919)

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.

If you are building Rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make GLIBC work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with Rust. See [maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building Rust wheels and cross-compiling.
