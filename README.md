[Documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.org)

<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

|   | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x |
|---------------|----|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|-----|
| CPython 3.6   | ✅ | N/A | ✅  | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |
| CPython 3.7   | ✅ | N/A | ✅  | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |

| PyPy 3.7 v7.3 | ✅ | N/A | ✅  | N/A | ✅¹ | ✅¹  | ✅¹ | N/A | N/A |

<sup>¹ PyPy is only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+, and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|--------------|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹          |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |              |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅           |
| AppVeyor        | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |              |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         |              |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    |       |         |              |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. Because it uses system Python from Python.org on macOS and Windows, it will try to install packages globally - not what you expect from a build tool! Instead, isolated CI services like those mentioned above are ideal. For Linux builds, it uses manylinux docker images, so those can be done locally for testing in a pinch.

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macOS-10.15]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==2.2.2

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!-- START bin/update_readme_changelog.py -->

<!-- this section was generated by bin/update_readme_changelog.py -- do not edit manually -->

### v2.2.2

_26 October 2021_

- 🐛 Fix bug in the GitHub Action step causing a syntax error (#895)

### v2.2.1

_26 October 2021_

- 🛠 Added a `config-file` option on the GitHub Action to specify something other than pyproject.toml in your GitHub Workflow file. (#883)
- 🐛 Fix missing resources in sdist and released wheel on PyPI. We've also made some internal changes to our release processes to make them more reliable. (#893, #894)

### v2.2.0

_22 October 2021_

- 🌟 Added support for [musllinux](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0656/). Support for this new wheel format lets projects build wheels for Linux distributions that use [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/), notably, [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) Docker containers. (#768)

  Musllinux builds are enabled by default. If you're not ready to build musllinux, add `*-musllinux_*` to your [`CIBW_SKIP`/`skip`](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#build-skip) option. Or, you might have to make some changes to your options - to simplify that process, you can use...

- 🌟 TOML option overrides! This provides much greater flexibility in configuration via pyproject.toml. (#854)

  You can now set build options for any subset of your builds using a match pattern. So, for example, you can customise CPython 3.8 builds with an override on `cp38-*` or musllinux builds by selecting `*musllinux*`. Check out [the docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options/#overrides) for more info on the specifics.

- 🛠 Added support for building PyPy wheels on macOS 11 CI runners. (#875)

- 🛠 Setting an empty string for the [`CIBW_*_IMAGE`](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image) option will now fallthrough to the config file or cibuildwheel's default, rather than causing an error. This makes the option easier to use in CI build matricies. (#829)

- 🛠 Support for TOML 1.0 when reading config files, via the `tomli` package. (#876)

<sup>Note: This version is not available on PyPI due to some missing resources in the release files. Please use a later version instead.</sup>

### v2.1.3

_6 October 2021_

- 🛠 Updated CPython 3.10 to the 3.10.0 final release

### v2.1.2

_14 September 2021_

- 🛠 Updated CPython 3.10 to 3.10.0rc2
- 📚 Multiple docs updates
- 🐛 Improved warnings when built binaries are bundled into the container on Linux. (#807)

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.
