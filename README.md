[Documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.org)

<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

|   | macOS 10.6+ intel | macOS 10.9+ x86_64 | manylinux i686 | manylinux x86_64 |  Windows 32bit | Windows 64bit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python 2.7 | ✅ |    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅¹ | ✅¹ |
| Python 3.5 | ✅ |    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |
| Python 3.6 | ✅ |    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |
| Python 3.7 | ✅ |    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |
| Python 3.8 |    | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  |

> ¹ Not supported on Travis

- Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows (32 and 64bit) wheels using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` currently works on **Travis CI** and **Azure Pipelines** to build wheels for all three supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). On **CircleCI** Linux and macOS wheels can be built, and on **AppVeyor** Windows is supported.

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| Travis CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| AppVeyor        |       |       | ✅      |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         |

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. Because it uses system Python from Python.org it will try to install packages globally - not what you expect from a build tool! Instead, isolated CI services like Travis CI, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor are ideal.

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux and macOS wheels on Travis CI, and upload them to PyPI whenever you tag a version, you could use this `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
language: python

matrix:
  include:
    # perform a linux build
    - sudo: required
      services:
        - docker
      env: PIP=pip
    # and a mac build
    - os: osx
      language: generic
      env: PIP=pip2

env:
  global:
    - TWINE_USERNAME=joerick
      # Note: TWINE_PASSWORD is set in Travis settings

script:
  - $PIP install cibuildwheel==1.0.0

  # build the wheels, put them into './wheelhouse'
  - cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse

  # if the release was tagged, upload them to PyPI
  - |
    if [[ $TRAVIS_TAG ]]; then
      python -m pip install twine
      python -m twine upload wheelhouse/*.whl
    fi
```

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` runs the wheel through delocate or auditwheel, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog

If you're upgrading and you need the old behaviour, use `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD={pip} install .`, or install exactly the dependencies you need in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD`. See #18.

- ⚠️ Removed Python 2.6 support on Linux (#12)

### 0.2.1

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

If `cibuildwheel` is too limited for your needs, consider [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It can do a lot more than this project - it's used to build SciPy!
