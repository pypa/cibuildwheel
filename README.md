<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

<sup>¹ PyPy is only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Alpine 3.14 and very briefly 3.15's default python3 [was not able to load](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/934) musllinux wheels. This has been fixed; please upgrade the python package if using Alpine from before the fix.</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Cross-compilation not supported with PyPy - to build these wheels you need to run cibuildwheel on an Apple Silicon machine.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ CPython 3.12 is built by default using Python RCs, starting with cibuildwheel 2.15.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+, and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅²       | ✅⁴         |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |           | ✅²       | ✅⁴         |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             |
| AppVeyor        | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |           | ✅²       | ✅⁴         |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅²       |             |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅¹       |           |             |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅³   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#universal2). It is not possible to test `arm64` and the `arm64` part of a `universal2` wheel on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#universal2). Thanks to Rosetta 2 emulation, it is possible to test `x86_64` and both parts of a `universal2` wheel on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup>

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macOS-11]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==2.16.4

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

For more information, including PyPI deployment, and the use of other CI services or the dedicated GitHub Action, check out the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.org) and the [examples](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/tree/main/examples).

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.

If you are building Rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make GLIBC work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with Rust. See [maturin-action](https://github.com/messense/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building Rust wheels and cross-compiling.
