<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

<sup>¹ Not supported on Travis</sup><br>
<sup>² Beta support until Travis CI fixes <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/no-space-left-on-device-for-system-z/5954/11">a bug</a></sup><br>
<sup>³ Python 3.9 is not yet ABI stable, so you shouldn't publish wheels with it yet. But if you want to check that your wheels build on Python 3.9, try our [`python3.9` branch](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/pull/382)!</sup>

- Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows wheels for CPython and PyPy using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` currently works on **Travis CI**, **Azure Pipelines**, **AppVeyor** and **GitHub Actions** to build wheels for all three supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). On **CircleCI** Linux and macOS wheels can be built.

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| Travis CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| AppVeyor        | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         |

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. Because it uses system Python from Python.org it will try to install packages globally - not what you expect from a build tool! Instead, isolated CI services like Travis CI, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines and AppVeyor are ideal.

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on Travis CI and upload them to PyPI whenever you tag a version, you could use this `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
language: python

jobs:
  include:
    # perform a linux build
    - services: docker
    # and a mac build
    - os: osx
      language: shell
    # and a windows build
    - os: windows
      language: shell
      before_install:
        - choco install python --version 3.8.0
        - export PATH="/c/Python38:/c/Python38/Scripts:$PATH"

env:
  global:
    - TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
    # Note: TWINE_PASSWORD is set to a PyPI API token in Travis settings

install:
  - python3 -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.4.2

script:
  # build the wheels, put them into './wheelhouse'
  - python3 -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse

after_success:
  # if the release was tagged, upload them to PyPI
  - |
    if [[ $TRAVIS_TAG ]]; then
      python3 -m pip install twine
      python3 -m twine upload wheelhouse/*.whl
    fi
```

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

### 1.4.2

_25 May 2020_

- 🛠 Dependency updates, including CPython 3.8.3 & manylinux images.
- 🛠 Lots of internal updates - type annotations and checking using mypy, and
  a new integration testing system.
- ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel using Python 3.5. cibuildwheel
  will continue to build Python 3.5 wheels until EOL.

### 1.4.1

_4 May 2020_

- 🐛 Fix a bug causing programs running inside the i686 manylinux images to
  think they were running x86_64 and target the wrong architecture. (#336,
  #338)

### 1.4.0

_2 May 2020_

- ✨ Deterministic builds. cibuildwheel now locks the versions of the tools it
  uses. This means that pinning your version of cibuildwheel pins the versions
  of pip, setuptools, manylinux etc. that are used under the hood. This should
  make things more reliable. But note that we don't control the entire build
  environment on macOS and Windows, where the version of Xcode and Visual
  Studio can still effect things.

  This can be controlled using the [CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#dependency-versions)
  and [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image)
  options - if you always want to use the latest toolchain, you can still do
  that, or you can specify your own pip constraints file and manylinux image.
  (#256)
- ✨ Added `package_dir` command line option, meaning we now support building
  a package that lives in a subdirectory and pulls in files from the wider
  project. See [the `package_dir` option help](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#command-line-options)
  for more information.

  Note that this change makes the working directory (where you call
  cibuildwheel from) relevant on Linux, as it's considered the 'project' and
  will be copied into the Docker container. If your builds are slower on this
  version, that's likely the reason. `cd` to your project and then call
  `cibuildwheel` from there. (#319, #295)
- 🛠 On macOS, we make `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` default to `10.9` if it's
  not set. This should make things more consistent between Python versions.
- 🛠 Dependency updates - CPython 3.7.7, CPython 2.7.18, Pypy 7.3.1.

### 1.3.0

_12 March 2020_

- ✨ Add support for building on Github Actions! Check out the
  [docs](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/#github-actions)
  for information on how to set it up. (#194)
- ✨ Add the `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST` option, which lets you run a command to
  prepare the environment before your tests are run. (#242)

### 1.2.0

_8 March 2020_

- ✨ Add support for building PyPy wheels, across Manylinux, macOS, and
  Windows. (#185)
- ✨ Added the ability to build ARM64 (aarch64), ppc64le, and s390x wheels,
  using manylinux2014 and Travis CI. (#273)
- ✨ You can now build macOS wheels on Appveyor. (#230)
- 🛠 Changed default macOS minimum target to 10.9, from 10.6. This allows the
  use of more modern C++ libraries, among other things. (#156)
- 🛠 Stop building universal binaries on macOS. We now only build x86_64
  wheels on macOS. (#220)
- ✨ Allow chaining of commands using `&&` and `||` on Windows inside
  CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD and CIBW_TEST_COMMAND. (#293)
- 🛠 Improved error reporting for failed Cython builds due to stale .so files
  (#263)
- 🛠 Update CPython from 3.7.5 to 3.7.6 and from 3.8.0 to 3.8.2 on Mac/Windows
- 🛠 Improved error messages when a bad config breaks cibuildwheel's PATH
  variable. (#264)
- ⚠️ Removed support for *running* cibuildwheel on Python 2.7. cibuildwheel
  will continue to build Python 2.7 wheels for a little while. (#265)

### 1.1.0

_7 December 2019_

- ✨ Add support for building manylinux2014 wheels. To use, set
  `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE` and CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE to
  `manylinux2014`.
- ✨ Add support for [Linux on Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2018/03/06/appveyor-for-linux/) (#204, #207)
- ✨ Add `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND` env variable, for changing how
  `auditwheel` or `delocate` are invoked, or testing an equivalent on
  Windows. (#211)
- 📚 Added some travis example configs - these are available in /examples. (#228)

### 1.0.0

_10 November 2019_

- ✨ Add support for building Python 3.8 wheels! (#180)
- ✨ Add support for building manylinux2010 wheels. cibuildwheel will now
  build using the manylinux2010 images by default. If your project is still
  manylinux1 compatible, you should get both manylinux1 and manylinux2010
  wheels - you can upload both to PyPI. If you always require manylinux1 wheels, you can
  build using the old manylinux1 image using the [manylinux image](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/options/#manylinux-image) option.
  (#155)
- 📚 Documentation is now on its [own mini-site](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io),
   rather than on the README (#169)
- ✨ Add support for building Windows wheels on Travis CI. (#160)
- 🛠 If you set `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`, your tests now run in a virtualenv. (#164)
- 🛠 Windows now uses Python as installed by nuget, rather than the versions
  installed by the various CI providers. (#180)
- 🛠 Update Python from 2.7.16 to 2.7.17 and 3.7.4 to 3.7.5 on macOS (#171)
- ⚠️ Removed support for Python 3.4 (#168)

### 0.12.0

_29 September 2019_

- ✨ Add CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS option, to allow testing using extra_require
  options. For example, set `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS=test,qt` to make the wheel
  installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`
- 🛠 Update Python from 3.7.2 to 3.7.4 on macOS
- 🛠 Update OpenSSL patch to 1.0.2t on macOS

### 0.11.1

_28 May 2019_

- 🐛 Fix missing file in the release tarball, that was causing problems with
  Windows builds (#141)

### 0.11.0

_26 May 2019_

- ✨ Add support for building on Azure pipelines! This lets you build all
  Linux, Mac and Windows wheels on one service, so it promises to be the
  easiest to set up! Check out the quickstart in the docs, or
  [cibuildwheel-azure-example](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel-azure-example)
  for an example project. (#126, #132)
- 🛠 Internal change - the end-to-end test projects format was updated, so we
  can more precisely assert what should be produced for each one. (#136, #137).

### 0.10.2

_10 March 2019_

- 🛠 Revert temporary fix in macOS, that was working around a bug in pip 19 (#129)
- 🛠 Update Python to 2.7.16 on macOS

### 0.9.1

_18 June 2018_

- 🛠 Removed the need to use `{python}` and `{pip}` in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` statements, by ensuring the correct version is always on the path at `python` and `pip` instead. (#60)
- 🛠 We now patch the _ssl module on Python 3.4 and 3.5 so these versions can still make SSL web requests using TLS 1.2 while building. (#71)

### 0.9.0

_18 June 2018_

- ✨ Add support for Python 3.7 (#73)

### 0.8.0

- ⚠️ Removed Python 2.6 support on Linux (#12)

### 0.2.1

_11 June 2017_

### 0.2.0

_13 April 2017_

- ✨ Added `CIBW_SKIP` option, letting users explicitly skip a build
- ✨ Added `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` option, letting users run a shell command before the build starts

### 0.1.3

_31 March 2017_

- 🌟 First public release!

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

If `cibuildwheel` is too limited for your needs, consider [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It can do a lot more than this project - it's used to build SciPy!
