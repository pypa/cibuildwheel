[Documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io)

<!--intro-start-->

Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.


What does it do?
----------------

While cibuildwheel itself requires a recent Python version to run (we support the last three releases), it can target the following versions to build wheels:

|                    | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | Windows Arm64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x | manylinux<br/>musllinux armv7l | iOS | Pyodide |

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

- Builds manylinux, musllinux, macOS 10.9+ (10.13+ for Python 3.12+), and Windows wheels for CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy
- Works on GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/1.x/) if you need to build unsupported versions of Python, such as Python 2.

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` runs inside a CI service. Supported platforms depend on which service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM | iOS |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅          | ✅³  |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅³  |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             |     |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅³  |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             | ✅³  |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             |      |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Requires a macOS runner; runs tests on the simulator for the runner's architecture.</sup>

<!--intro-end-->

Example setup
-------------

To build manylinux, musllinux, macOS, and Windows wheels on GitHub Actions, you could use this `.github/workflows/wheels.yml`:

<!--generic-github-start-->
```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.0.0b5

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```
<!--generic-github-end-->

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` repairs the wheel with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some license implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Changelog
=========

<!-- [[[cog from readme_changelog import mini_changelog; print(mini_changelog()) ]]] -->

### v3.0.0

Not yet released, but available for testing.

Note - when using a beta version, be sure to check the [latest docs](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/), rather than the stable version, which is still on v2.X.

<!--
note to self, when doing final release, change to docs URLs in this section to the stable version!
-->

If you've used previous versions of the beta:
- ⚠️ Previous betas of v3.0 changed the working directory for tests. This has been rolled back to the v2.x behaviour, so you might need to change configs if you adapted to the beta 1 or 2 behaviour. See [issue #2406](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/2406) for more information.
- ⚠️ GraalPy shipped with the identifier `gp242-*` in previous betas, this has been changed to `gp311_242-*` to be consistent with other interpreters, and to fix a bug with GraalPy and project requires-python detection. If you were using GraalPy, you might need to update your config to use the new identifier.
- ⚠️ `test-sources` now uses `project` directory instead of the `package` directory (matching the docs).

#### v3.0.0b5

_3 June 2025_

- ✨ Support multiple commands on iOS, joined by `&&`, like the other platforms. (#2432)
- ✨ Add `pyodide-prerelease` enable option, with an early build of 0.28 (Python 3.13). (#2431)
- 🛠 test-sources now uses the `project` directory instead of the `package` directory (matching the docs). (#2437)
- 🛠 Fixed a bug with GraalPy if vsdevcmd prints an error. Cirrus CI works again. (#2414)
- 🛠 Use the standard Schema line for the integrated JSONSchema. (#2433)
- 📚 Use Python 3.14 color output in docs CLI output. (#2407)

#### v3.0.0b4

_29 May 2025_

- 🛠 Dependency updates, including Python 3.14.0b2. (#2371)
- 🛠 Remove the addition of `PYTHONSAFEPATH` to `test-environment`. (#2429)
- 📚 README table now matches docs and auto-updates. (#2427, #2428)

#### v3.0.0b3

_28 May 2025_

- 🛠 Reverts the test working dir (when test-sources isn't set) to a temporary dir, rather than the project. (#2420)
- 📚 Docs now primarily use the pyproject.toml name of options, rather than the environment variable name. (#2389)

#### v3.0.0b2

_25 May 2025_

- ✨ Adds the [`CIBW_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#test-environment) option, which allows you to set environment variables for the test command. cibuildwheel now sets `PYTHONSAFEPATH=1` in test environments by default, to avoid picking up package imports from the local directory - we want to test the installed wheel, not the source tree! You can change that, or any other environment variable in the test environment using this option. (#2388)
- ✨ Improves support for Pyodide builds and adds the [`CIBW_PYODIDE_VERSION`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/latest/options/#pyodide-version) option, which allows you to specify the version of Pyodide to use for builds. (#2002)

========

Another very similar tool to consider is [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a shell script toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It is used as a basis to build some of the big data science tools, like SciPy.

If you are building Rust wheels, you can get by without some of the tricks required to make GLIBC work via manylinux; this is especially relevant for cross-compiling, which is easy with Rust. See [maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) for a tool that is optimized for building Rust wheels and cross-compiling.
