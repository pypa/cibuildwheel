# In this configuration, the package is tested against multiple versions of python
# on Linux and on one version of Python on Windows. If and only if all tests pass
# will the wheels be built and deployed. Further, deployment is only initiated if
# the current branch is "master", the current commit is tagged, and the current
# repo is yours (e.g. it won't run on a Pull Request). For convenience, a source
# distribution is also created.
