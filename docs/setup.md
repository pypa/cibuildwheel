# Setup

## Run cibuildwheel locally (optional) {: #local}

Before getting to CI setup, it can be convenient to test cibuildwheel
locally to quickly iterate and track down issues without even touching CI.

Install cibuildwheel and run a build like this:

```sh
# using pipx (https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
pipx run cibuildwheel

# or,
pip install cibuildwheel
cibuildwheel
```

You should see the builds taking place. You can experiment with options using environment variables or pyproject.toml.

!!! tab "Environment variables"

    cibuildwheel will read config from the environment. Syntax varies, depending on your shell:

    > POSIX shell (Linux/macOS)

    ```sh
    # run a command to set up the build system
    export CIBW_BEFORE_ALL='uname -a'

    cibuildwheel
    ```

    > CMD (Windows)

    ```bat
    set CIBW_BEFORE_ALL='uname -a'

    cibuildwheel
    ```

!!! tab "pyproject.toml"

    If you write your options into [`pyproject.toml`](options.md#configuration-file), you can work on your options locally, and they'll be automatically picked up when running in CI.

    > pyproject.toml

    ```
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    before-all = "uname -a"
    ```

    Then invoke cibuildwheel, like:

    ```console
    cibuildwheel
    ```

### Linux builds

If you've got [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on
your development machine, you can run a Linux build.

!!! tip
    You can run the Linux build on any platform. Even Windows can run
    Linux containers these days, but there are a few  hoops to jump
    through. Check [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/quick-start-windows-10-linux)
    for more info.

Because the builds are happening in manylinux Docker containers,
they're perfectly reproducible.

The only side effect to your system will be docker images being pulled.

### macOS / Windows builds

Pre-requisite: you need to have native build tools installed.

Because the builds are happening without full isolation, there might be some
differences compared to CI builds (Xcode version, Visual Studio version,
OS version, local files, ...) that might prevent you from finding an issue only
seen in CI.

In order to speed-up builds, cibuildwheel will cache the tools it needs to be
reused for future builds. The folder used for caching is system/user dependent and is
reported in the printed preamble of each run (e.g. "Cache folder: /Users/Matt/Library/Caches/cibuildwheel").

You can override the cache folder using the ``CIBW_CACHE_PATH`` environment variable.

!!! warning
    cibuildwheel uses official python.org macOS installers for CPython but
    those can only be installed globally.

    In order not to mess with your system, cibuildwheel won't install those if they are
    missing. Instead, it will error out with a message to let you install the missing
    CPython:

    ```console
    Error: CPython 3.6 is not installed.
    cibuildwheel will not perform system-wide installs when running outside of CI.
    To build locally, install CPython 3.6 on this machine, or, disable this version of Python using CIBW_SKIP=cp36-macosx_*

    Download link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.8/python-3.6.8-macosx10.9.pkg
    ```

### Pyodide (WebAssembly) builds (experimental)

Pre-requisite: you need to have a matching host version of Python (unlike all
other cibuildwheel platforms). Linux host highly recommended; macOS hosts may
work (e.g. invoking `pytest` directly in [`CIBW_TEST_COMMAND`](options.md#test-command) is [currently failing](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4802)) and Windows hosts will not work.

You must target pyodide with `--platform pyodide` (or use `--only` on the identifier).

## Configure a CI service

### GitHub Actions [linux/mac/windows] {: #github-actions}

To build Linux, Mac, and Windows wheels using GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows/build_wheels.yml` file in your repo.

!!! tab "Action"
    For GitHub Actions, `cibuildwheel` provides an action you can use. This is
    concise and enables easier auto updating via GitHub's Dependabot; see
    [Automatic updates](faq.md#automatic-updates).

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    {% include "../examples/github-minimal.yml" %}
    ```

    Use `env:` to pass [build options](options.md) and `with:` to set
    `package-dir: .`, `output-dir: wheelhouse` and `config-file: ''`
    locations (those values are the defaults).

!!! tab "pipx"
    The GitHub Actions runners have pipx installed, so you can easily build in
    just one line. This is internally how the action works; the main benefit of
    the action form is easy updates via GitHub's Dependabot.

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    name: Build

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build_wheels:
        name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
          matrix:
            # macos-13 is an intel runner, macos-14 is apple silicon
            os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-13, macos-14]

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Build wheels
            run: pipx run cibuildwheel==2.21.1

          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
            with:
              name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
              path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
    ```

!!! tab "Generic"
    This is the most generic form using setup-python and pip; it looks the most
    like the other CI examples. If you want to avoid having setup that takes
    advantage of GitHub Actions features or pipx being preinstalled, this might
    appeal to you.

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    name: Build

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build_wheels:
        name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
          matrix:
            # macos-13 is an intel runner, macos-14 is apple silicon
            os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-13, macos-14]

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # Used to host cibuildwheel
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

          - name: Install cibuildwheel
            run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==2.21.1

          - name: Build wheels
            run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse

          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
            with:
              name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
              path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
    ```

## Next steps

Once you've got the wheel building successfully, you might want to set up [testing](options.md#test-command) or [automatic releases to PyPI](deliver-to-pypi.md#automatic-method).

<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    $('.toctree-l3>a, .rst-content h3').each(function(i, el) {

      if (match) {
        var iconHTML = $.map(match[2].split('/'), function(ident) {
          switch (ident) {
