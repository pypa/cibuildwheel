# GitHub Actions [linux/mac/windows] {: #github-actions}

To build Linux, Mac, and Windows wheels using GitHub Actions, create a `.github/workflows/build_wheels.yml` file in your repo.

!!! tab "Action"
    For GitHub Actions, `cibuildwheel` provides an action you can use. This is
    concise and enables easier auto updating via GitHub's Dependabot; see
    [Automatic updates](faq.md#automatic-updates).

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    {% include "../examples/github-minimal.yml" %}
    ```


    You can use `env:` with the action just like you would with `run:`; you can
    also use `with:` to set the command line options: `package-dir: .` and
    `output-dir: wheelhouse` (those values are the defaults).

!!! tab "pipx"
    The GitHub Actions runners have pipx installed, so you can easily build in
    just one line. This is internally how the action works; the main benefit of
    the action form is easy updates via GitHub's Dependabot.

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    name: Build

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build_wheels:
        name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
          matrix:
            os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macos-10.15]

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Build wheels
            run: pipx run cibuildwheel==1.11.0

          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
              path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
    ```

!!! tab "Generic"
    This is the most generic form using setup-python and pip; it looks the most
    like the other CI examples. If you want to avoid having setup that takes
    advantage of GitHub Actions features or pipx being preinstalled, this might
    appeal to you.

    > .github/workflows/build_wheels.yml

    ```yaml
    name: Build

    on: [push, pull_request]

    jobs:
      build_wheels:
        name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
        runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
          matrix:
            os: [ubuntu-20.04, windows-2019, macos-10.15]

        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2

          # Used to host cibuildwheel
          - uses: actions/setup-python@v2

          - name: Install cibuildwheel
            run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==1.11.0

          - name: Build wheels
            run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse

          - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
              path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
    ```


Commit this file, and push to GitHub - either to your default branch, or to a PR branch. The build should start automatically.

For more info on this file, check out the [docs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

[`examples/github-deploy.yml`](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/blob/master/examples/github-deploy.yml) extends this minimal example with a demonstration of how to automatically upload the built wheels to PyPI.


# Azure Pipelines [linux/mac/windows] {: #azure-pipelines}

To build Linux, Mac, and Windows wheels on Azure Pipelines, create a `azure-pipelines.yml` file in your repo.

> azure-pipelines.yml

```yaml
{% include "../examples/azure-pipelines-minimal.yml" %}
```

!!! note
    To support Python 3.5 on Windows, make sure to specify the use of `{vmImage: 'vs2017-win2016'}` on Windows, to ensure the required toolchain is available.

Commit this file, enable building of your repo on Azure Pipelines, and push.

Wheels will be stored for you and available through the Pipelines interface. For more info on this file, check out the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema).

# Travis CI [linux/windows] {: #travis-ci}

To build Linux and Windows wheels on Travis CI, create a `.travis.yml` file in your repo.

> .travis.yml

```yaml
{% include "../examples/travis-ci-minimal.yml" %}
```

Note that building Windows Python 2.7 wheels on Travis is unsupported unless using a newer compiler [via a workaround](cpp_standards.md).

Commit this file, enable building of your repo on Travis CI, and push.

Then setup a deployment method by following the [Travis CI deployment docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/), or see [Delivering to PyPI](deliver-to-pypi.md). For more info on `.travis.yml`, check out the [docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/).

[`examples/travis-ci-deploy.yml`](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/blob/master/examples/travis-ci-deploy.yml) extends this minimal example with a demonstration of how to automatically upload the built wheels to PyPI.

# AppVeyor [linux/mac/windows] {: #appveyor}

To build Linux, Mac, and Windows wheels on AppVeyor, create an `appveyor.yml` file in your repo.

> appveyor.yml

```yaml
{% include "../examples/appveyor-minimal.yml" %}
```

Commit this file, enable building of your repo on AppVeyor, and push.

AppVeyor will store the built wheels for you - you can access them from the project console. Alternatively, you may want to store them in the same place as the Travis CI build. See [AppVeyor deployment docs](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/) for more info, or see [Delivering to PyPI](deliver-to-pypi.md) below.

For more info on this config file, check out the [docs](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/).

# CircleCI [linux/mac] {: #circleci}

To build Linux and Mac wheels on CircleCI, create a `.circleci/config.yml` file in your repo,

> .circleci/config.yml

```yaml
{% include "../examples/circleci-minimal.yml" %}
```

Commit this file, enable building of your repo on CircleCI, and push.

!!! note
    CircleCI doesn't enable free macOS containers for open source by default, but you can ask for access. See [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/oss/#overview) for more information.

CircleCI will store the built wheels for you - you can access them from the project console. Check out the CircleCI [docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#section=configuration) for more info on this config file.

# Gitlab CI [linux] {: #gitlab-ci}

To build Linux wheels on Gitlab CI, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repo,

> .gitlab-ci.yml

```yaml
{% include "../examples/gitlab-minimal.yml" %}
```

Commit this file, and push to Gitlab. The pipeline should start automatically.

Gitlab will store the built wheels for you - you can access them from the Pipelines view. Check out the Gitlab [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/) for more info on this config file.
