## Setting options

cibuildwheel can either be configured using environment variables, or from
config file such as `pyproject.toml`.

### Environment variables {: #environment-variables}

Environment variables can be set in your CI config. For example, to configure
cibuildwheel to run tests, add the following YAML to your CI config file:

!!! tab "GitHub Actions"

    > .github/workflows/*.yml ([docs](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables)) (can be global, in job, or in step)

    ```yaml
    env:
      CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest
      CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "pytest {project}/tests"
    ```

!!! tab "Azure Pipelines"

    > azure-pipelines.yml ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables))

    ```yaml
    variables:
      CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest
      CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "pytest {project}/tests"
    ```

!!! tab "Travis CI"

    > .travis.yml ([docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/))

    ```yaml
    env:
      global:
        - CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES=pytest
        - CIBW_TEST_COMMAND="pytest {project}/tests"
    ```

!!! tab "AppVeyor"

    > appveyor.yml ([docs](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration/#environment-variables))

    ```yaml
    environment:
      global:
        CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest
        CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "pytest {project}\\tests"
    ```

!!! tab "CircleCI"

    > .circleci/config.yml ([docs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#environment))

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      job_name:
        environment:
          CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest
          CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "pytest {project}/tests"
    ```

!!! tab "Gitlab CI"

    > .gitlab-ci.yml ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html#create-a-custom-variable-in-gitlab-ciyml))

    ```yaml
    linux:
      variables:
        CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest
        CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "pytest {project}/tests"
    ```

### Configuration file {: #configuration-file}

You can configure cibuildwheel with a `pyproject.toml` file. Options have the
same names as the environment variable overrides, but are placed in
`[tool.cibuildwheel]` and are lower case, with dashes, following common [TOML][]
practice. Anything placed in subsections `linux`, `windows`, or `macos` will
only affect those platforms. Lists can be used instead of strings for items that are natually a list.
Multiline strings also work just like in in the environment variables.
Environment variables will take precedence if defined.

The example above using environment variables could have been written like this:

```toml
[tool.cibuildwheel]
test-requires = "pytest"
test-command = "pytest {project}/tests"
```

The complete set of defaults for the current version of cibuildwheel are shown below:

```toml
{% include "../cibuildwheel/resources/defaults.toml" %}
```


!!! tip
    Static configuration works across all CI systems, and can be used locally if
    you run `cibuildwheel --plat linux`. This is preferred, but environment
    variables are better if you need to change per-matrix element
    (`CIBW_BUILD` is often in this category, for example), or if you cannot or do
    not want to change a `pyproject.toml` file. You can specify a different file to
    use with `--config-file` on the command line, as well.


## Build selection

### `CIBW_PLATFORM` {: #platform}

> Override the auto-detected target platform

Options: `auto` `linux` `macos` `windows`

Default: `auto`

`auto` will auto-detect platform using environment variables, such as `TRAVIS_OS_NAME`/`APPVEYOR`/`CIRCLECI`.

- For `linux`, you need Docker running, on macOS or Linux.
- For `macos`, you need a Mac machine. Note that cibuildwheel is going to install MacPython on your system, so you probably don't want to run this on your development machine.
- For `windows`, you need to run in Windows. cibuildwheel will install required versions of Python to `C:\cibw\python` using NuGet.

This option can also be set using the [command-line option](#command-line) `--platform`. This option is not available in the `pyproject.toml` config.

!!! tip
    If you have Docker installed, you can locally debug your cibuildwheel Linux config, instead of pushing to CI to test every change. For example:

    ```bash
    export CIBW_BUILD='cp37-*'
    export CIBW_TEST_COMMAND='pytest {package}/tests'
    cibuildwheel --platform linux .
    ```


### `CIBW_BUILD`, `CIBW_SKIP` {: #build-skip}

> Choose the Python versions to build

List of builds to build and skip. Each build has an identifier like `cp38-manylinux_x86_64` or `cp37-macosx_x86_64` - you can list specific ones to build and cibuildwheel will only build those, and/or list ones to skip and cibuildwheel won't try to build them.

When both options are specified, both conditions are applied and only builds with a tag that matches `CIBW_BUILD` and does not match `CIBW_SKIP` will be built.

When setting the options, you can use shell-style globbing syntax, as per [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) with the addition of curly bracket syntax `{option1,option2}`, provided by [bracex](https://pypi.org/project/bracex/). All the build identifiers supported by cibuildwheel are shown below:

<div class="build-id-table-marker"></div>

|              | macOS                                                               | Windows                       | Manylinux Intel                               | Manylinux Other                                                            |

| PyPy3.7 v7.3 | pp37-macosx_x86_64                                                  |                pp37-win_amd64 | pp37-manylinux_x86_64                         |                                                                            |


The list of supported and currently selected build identifiers can also be retrieved by passing the `--print-build-identifiers` flag to cibuildwheel.
The format is `python_tag-platform_tag`, with tags similar to those in [PEP 425](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/#details).

For CPython, the minimally supported macOS version is 10.9; for PyPy 3.7, macOS 10.13 or higher is required.

See the [cibuildwheel 1 documentation](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/) for past end of life versions of Python, and PyPy2.7.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Only build on CPython 3.6
    CIBW_BUILD: cp36-*

    # Skip building on CPython 3.6 on the Mac
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-macosx_x86_64

    # Skip building on CPython 3.8 on the Mac
    CIBW_SKIP: cp38-macosx_x86_64

    # Skip building on CPython 3.6 on all platforms
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-*

    # Skip CPython 3.6 on Windows
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-win*

    # Skip CPython 3.6 on 32-bit Windows
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-win32

    # Skip CPython 3.6 and CPython 3.7
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-* cp37-*

    # Skip Python 3.6 on Linux
    CIBW_SKIP: cp36-manylinux*

    # Skip 32-bit builds
    CIBW_SKIP: "*-win32 *-manylinux_i686"

    # Disable building PyPy wheels on all platforms
    CIBW_SKIP: pp*
    ```

    Separate multiple selectors with a space.

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Only build on CPython 3.6
    build = "cp36-*"

    # Skip building on CPython 3.6 on the Mac
    skip = "cp36-macosx_x86_64"

    # Skip building on CPython 3.8 on the Mac
    skip = "cp38-macosx_x86_64"

    # Skip building on CPython 3.6 on all platforms
    skip = "cp36-*"

    # Skip CPython 3.6 on Windows
    skip = "cp36-win*"

    # Skip CPython 3.6 on 32-bit Windows
    skip = "cp36-win32"

    # Skip CPython 3.6 and CPython 3.7
    skip = ["cp36-*", "cp37-*"]

    # Skip Python 3.6 on Linux
    skip = "cp36-manylinux*"

    # Skip 32-bit builds
    skip = ["*-win32", "*-manylinux_i686"]

    # Disable building PyPy wheels on all platforms
    skip = "pp*"
    ```

    It is generally recommened to set `CIBW_BUILD` as an environment variable, though `skip`
    tends to be useful in a config file; you can statically declare that you don't
    support pypy, for example.

<style>
  .build-id-table-marker + table {
    font-size: 90%;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
  .rst-content .build-id-table-marker + table td,
  .rst-content .build-id-table-marker + table th {
    padding: 4px 4px;
  }
  .build-id-table-marker + table td:not(:first-child) {
    font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Liberation Mono, Menlo, monospace;
    font-size: 85%;
  }
  dt code {
    font-size: 100%;
    background-color: rgba(41, 128, 185, 0.1);
    padding: 0;
  }
</style>

### `CIBW_ARCHS` {: #archs}
> Change the architectures built on your machine by default.

A list of architectures to build.

On macOS, this option can be used to cross-compile between `x86_64`,
`universal2` and `arm64` for Apple Silicon support.

On Linux, this option can be used to build non-native architectures under
emulation. See [this guide](faq.md#emulation) for more information.

Options:

- Linux: `x86_64` `i686` `aarch64` `ppc64le` `s390x`
- macOS: `x86_64` `arm64` `universal2`
- Windows: `AMD64` `x86`
- `auto`: The default archs for your machine - see the table below.
    - `auto64`: Just the 64-bit auto archs
    - `auto32`: Just the 32-bit auto archs
- `native`: the native arch of the build machine - Matches [`platform.machine()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.machine).
- `all` : expands to all the architectures supported on this OS. You may want
  to use [CIBW_BUILD](#build-skip) with this option to target specific
  architectures via build selectors.

Default: `auto`

| Runner | `native` | `auto` | `auto64` | `auto32` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux / Intel | `x86_64` | `x86_64` `i686` | `x86_64` | `i686` |
| Windows / Intel | `AMD64` | `AMD64` `x86` | `AMD64` | `x86` |
| macOS / Intel | `x86_64` | `x86_64` | `x86_64` |  |
| macOS / Apple Silicon | `arm64` | `arm64` `universal2` | `arm64` `universal2`|  |

If not listed above, `auto` is the same as `native`.

[setup-qemu-action]: https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action
[binfmt]: https://hub.docker.com/r/tonistiigi/binfmt

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
 `CIBW_ARCHS_MACOS` | `CIBW_ARCHS_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_ARCHS_LINUX`

This option can also be set using the [command-line option](#command-line) `--archs`.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Build `universal2` and `arm64` wheels on an Intel runner.
    # Note that the `arm64` wheel and the `arm64` part of the `universal2`
    # wheel cannot be tested in this configuration.
    CIBW_ARCHS_MACOS: "x86_64 universal2 arm64"

    # On an Linux Intel runner with qemu installed, build Intel and ARM wheels
    CIBW_ARCHS_LINUX: "auto aarch64"
    ```

    Separate multiple archs with a space.

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    # Build `universal2` and `arm64` wheels on an Intel runner.
    # Note that the `arm64` wheel and the `arm64` part of the `universal2`
    # wheel cannot be tested in this configuration.
    [tool.cibuildwheel.macos]
    archs: ["x86_64", "universal2", "arm64"]

    # On an Linux Intel runner with qemu installed, build Intel and ARM wheels
    [tool.cibuildwheel.linux]
    archs: ["auto", "aarch64"]
    ```

    It is generally recommmended to use the environment variable or
    command-line option for Linux, as selecting archs often depends
    on your specific runner having qemu installed.


###  `CIBW_PROJECT_REQUIRES_PYTHON` {: #requires-python}
> Manually set the Python compatibility of your project

By default, cibuildwheel reads your package's Python compatibility from
`pyproject.toml` following [PEP621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/)
or from `setup.cfg`; finally it will try to inspect the AST of `setup.py` for a
simple keyword assignment in a top level function call. If you need to override
this behaviour for some reason, you can use this option.

When setting this option, the syntax is the same as `project.requires-python`,
using 'version specifiers' like `>=3.6`, according to
[PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers).

Default: reads your package's Python compatibility from `pyproject.toml`
(`project.requires-python`) or `setup.cfg` (`options.python_requires`) or
`setup.py` `setup(python_requires="...")`. If not found, cibuildwheel assumes
the package is compatible with all versions of Python that it can build.


!!! note
    Rather than using this option, it's recommended you set
    `project.requires-python` in `pyproject.toml` instead:
    Example `pyproject.toml`:

        [project]
        requires-python = ">=3.6"

        # Aside - in pyproject.toml you should always specify minimal build
        # system options, like this:

        [build-system]
        requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
        build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"


    Currently, setuptools has not yet added support for reading this value from
    pyproject.toml yet, and so does not copy it to Requires-Python in the wheel
    metadata. This mechanism is used by pip to scan through older versions of
    your package until it finds a release compatible with the current version
    of Python compatible when installing, so it is an important value to set if
    you plan to drop support for a version of Python in the future.

    If you don't want to list this value twice, you can also use the setuptools
    specific location in `setup.cfg` and cibuildwheel will detect it from
    there. Example `setup.cfg`:

        [options]
        python_requires = ">=3.6"


This option is not available in `pyproject.toml` under
`tool.cibuildwheel.project-requires-python`, since it should be set with the
[PEP621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/) location instead,
`project.requires-python`.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    CIBW_PROJECT_REQUIRES_PYTHON: ">=3.6"
    ```

###  `CIBW_PRERELEASE_PYTHONS` {: #prerelease-pythons}
> Enable building with pre-release versions of Python

During the beta period, when new versions of Python are being tested,
cibuildwheel will often gain early support for beta releases. If you would
like to test wheel building with these versions, you can enable this flag.

!!! caution
    This option is provided for testing purposes only. It is not
    recommended to distribute wheels built when `CIBW_PRERELEASE_PYTHONS` is
    set, such as uploading to PyPI.  Please _do not_ upload these wheels to
    PyPI, as they are not guaranteed to work with the final Python release.
    Once Python is ABI stable and enters the release candidate phase, that
    version of Python will become available without this flag.

Default: Off (0) if Python is available in beta phase. No effect otherwise.

This option can also be set using the [command-line option](#command-line) `--prerelease-pythons`. This option is not available in the `pyproject.toml` config.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Include latest Python beta
    CIBW_PRERELEASE_PYTHONS: True
    ```

## Build customization

### `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` {: #environment}
> Set environment variables needed during the build

A list of environment variables to set during the build. Bash syntax should be used, even on Windows.

You must set this variable to pass variables to Linux builds (since they execute in a Docker container). It also works for the other platforms.

You can use `$PATH` syntax to insert other variables, or the `$(pwd)` syntax to insert the output of other shell commands.

To specify more than one environment variable, separate the assignments by spaces.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_MACOS` | `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Set some compiler flags
    CIBW_ENVIRONMENT: "CFLAGS='-g -Wall' CXXFLAGS='-Wall'"

    # Append a directory to the PATH variable (this is expanded in the build environment)
    CIBW_ENVIRONMENT: "PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

    # Set BUILD_TIME to the output of the `date` command
    CIBW_ENVIRONMENT: "BUILD_TIME=$(date)"

    # Supply options to `pip` to affect how it downloads dependencies
    CIBW_ENVIRONMENT: "PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://pypi.myorg.com/simple"

    # Set two flags on linux only
    CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX: "BUILD_TIME=$(date) SAMPLE_TEXT=\"sample text\""
    ```

    Separate multiple values with a space.

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Set some compiler flags
    environment = "CFLAGS='-g -Wall' CXXFLAGS='-Wall'"

    # Set some compiler flags using a TOML table
    environment = { CFLAGS="-g -Wall", CXXFLAGS="-Wall" }

    # Append a directory to the PATH variable (this is expanded in the build environment)
    environment = { PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin" }

    # Set BUILD_TIME to the output of the `date` command
    environment = { BUILD_TIME="$(date)" }

    # Supply options to `pip` to affect how it downloads dependencies
    environment = { PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="https://pypi.myorg.com/simple" }

    # Set two flags on linux only
    [tool.cibuildwheel.linux]
    environment = { BUILD_TIME="$(date)", SAMPLE_TEXT="sample text" }

    # Alternate form with out-of-line table for setting a few values
    [tool.cibuildwheel.linux.environment]
    BUILD_TIME = "$(date)"
    SAMPLE_TEXT = "sample text"
    ```

    In configuration mode, you can use a [TOML][] table instead of a raw string as shown above.

!!! note
    cibuildwheel always defines the environment variable `CIBUILDWHEEL=1`. This can be useful for [building wheels with optional extensions](faq.md#building-packages-with-optional-c-extensions).

### `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL` {: #before-all}
> Execute a shell command on the build system before any wheels are built.

Shell command to prepare a common part of the project (e.g. build or install libraries which does not depend on the specific version of Python).

This option is very useful for the Linux build, where builds take place in isolated Docker containers managed by cibuildwheel. This command will run inside the container before the wheel builds start. Note, if you're building both `x86_64` and `i686` wheels (the default), your build uses two different Docker images. In that case, this command will execute twice - once per build container.

The placeholder `{package}` can be used here; it will be replaced by the path to the package being built by cibuildwheel.

On Windows and macOS, the version of Python available inside `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL` is whatever is available on the host machine. On Linux, a modern Python version is available on PATH.

Platform-specific environment variables also available:<br/>
`CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_MACOS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Build third party library
    CIBW_BEFORE_ALL: make -C third_party_lib

    # Install system library
    CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX: yum install -y libffi-dev

    # Chain multiple commands using && and > in a YAML file, like:
    CIBW_BEFORE_ALL: >
      yum install bzip2 -y &&
      make third_party
    ```

    For multiline commands, see the last example. The character `>` means that
    whitespace is collapsed to a single line, and '&&' between each command
    ensures that errors are not ignored. [Further reading on multiline YAML
    here.](https://yaml-multiline.info).

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    # Build third party library
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    before-all = "make -C third_party_lib"

    # Install system library
    [tool.cibuildwheel.linux]
    before-all = "yum install -y libffi-dev"

    # Run multiple commands using an array
    before-all = [
      "yum install bzip2 -y",
      "make third_party",
    ]
    ```

    In configuration files, you can use a TOML array, and each line will be run sequentially - joined with `&&`.

Note that manylinux2_24 builds occur inside a Debian9 docker, where
manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 builds occur inside a CentOS one. So for
`manylinux2_24` the `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX` command must use `apt-get -y`
instead.

### `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` {: #before-build}
> Execute a shell command preparing each wheel's build

A shell command to run before building the wheel. This option allows you to run a command in **each** Python environment before the `pip wheel` command. This is useful if you need to set up some dependency so it's available during the build.

If dependencies are required to build your wheel (for example if you include a header from a Python module), instead of using this command, we recommend adding requirements to a `pyproject.toml` file's `build-system.requires` array instead. This is reproducible, and users who do not get your wheels (such as Alpine or ClearLinux users) will still benefit.

The active Python binary can be accessed using `python`, and pip with `pip`; cibuildwheel makes sure the right version of Python and pip will be executed. The placeholder `{package}` can be used here; it will be replaced by the path to the package being built by cibuildwheel.

The command is run in a shell, so you can write things like `cmd1 && cmd2`.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
 `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_MACOS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_LINUX`

#### Examples

    ```

    In configuration mode, you can use a array, and the items will be joined with `&&`. In TOML, using a single-quote string will avoid escapes - useful for
    Windows paths.

!!! note
    If you need Python dependencies installed for the build, we recommend using
    `pyproject.toml`'s `build-system.requires` instead. This is an example
    `pyproject.toml` file:

        [build-system]
        requires = [
            "setuptools>=42",
            "wheel",
            "Cython",
            "numpy==1.13.3; python_version<'3.5'",
            "oldest-supported-numpy; python_version>='3.5'",
        ]

        build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

    This [PEP 517][]/[PEP 518][] style build allows you to completely control
    the build environment in cibuildwheel, [PyPA-build][], and pip, doesn't
    force downstream users to install anything they don't need, and lets you do
    more complex pinning (Cython, for example, requires a wheel to be built
    with an equal or earlier version of NumPy; pinning in this way is the only
    way to ensure your module works on all available NumPy versions).

### `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND` {: #repair-wheel-command}
> Execute a shell command to repair each (non-pure Python) built wheel

Default:

- on Linux: `'auditwheel repair -w {dest_dir} {wheel}'`
- on macOS: `'delocate-listdeps {wheel} && delocate-wheel --require-archs {delocate_archs} -w {dest_dir} {wheel}'`
- on Windows: `''`

A shell command to repair a built wheel by copying external library dependencies into the wheel tree and relinking them.
The command is run on each built wheel (except for pure Python ones) before testing it.

The following placeholders must be used inside the command and will be replaced by cibuildwheel:

- `{wheel}` for the absolute path to the built wheel
- `{dest_dir}` for the absolute path of the directory where to create the repaired wheel
- `{delocate_archs}` (macOS only) comma-separated list of architectures in the wheel.

The command is run in a shell, so you can run multiple commands like `cmd1 && cmd2`.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_MACOS` | `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_LINUX`

!!! tip
    cibuildwheel doesn't yet ship a default repair command for Windows.

    **If that's an issue for you, check out [delvewheel]** - a new package that aims to do the same as auditwheel or delocate for Windows.

    Because delvewheel is still relatively early-stage, cibuildwheel does not yet run it by default. However, we'd recommend giving it a try! See the examples below for usage.

    [Delvewheel]: https://github.com/adang1345/delvewheel

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Use delvewheel on windows
    CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_WINDOWS: "pip install delvewheel"
    CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_WINDOWS: "delvewheel repair -w {dest_dir} {wheel}"

    # Don't repair macOS wheels
    CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_MACOS: ""

    # Pass the `--lib-sdir .` flag to auditwheel on Linux
    CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_LINUX: "auditwheel repair --lib-sdir . -w {dest_dir} {wheel}"
    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    # Use delvewheel on windows
    [tool.cibuildwheel.windows]
    before_build = "pip install delvewheel"
    repair_wheel_command = "delvewheel repair -w {dest_dir} {wheel}"

    # Don't repair macOS wheels
    [tool.cibuildwheel.macos]
    repair_wheel_command = ""

    # Pass the `--lib-sdir .` flag to auditwheel on Linux
    [tool.cibuildwheel.linux]
    repair_wheel_command = "auditwheel repair --lib-sdir . -w {dest_dir} {wheel}"
    ```

    In configuration mode, you can use an inline array, and the items will be joined with `&&`.


### CIBW_MANYLINUX_*_IMAGE {: #manylinux-image}
> Specify alternative manylinux Docker images

The available options are:

- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_X86_64_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_I686_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_PYPY_X86_64_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_AARCH64_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_PPC64LE_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_S390X_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_PYPY_AARCH64_IMAGE`
- `CIBW_MANYLINUX_PYPY_I686_IMAGE`

Set an alternative Docker image to be used for building [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) wheels. cibuildwheel will then pull these instead of the default images, [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64), [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_i686`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_i686), [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64), [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_aarch64`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_aarch64), [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_ppc64le`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_ppc64le), and [`quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_s390x`](https://quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_s390x).

The value of this option can either be set to `manylinux1`, `manylinux2010`, `manylinux2014` or `manylinux_2_24` to use a pinned version of the [official manylinux images](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux). Alternatively, set these options to any other valid Docker image name. For PyPy, the `manylinux1` image is not available. For architectures other
than x86 (x86\_64 and i686) `manylinux2014` or `manylinux_2_24` must be used, because the first version of the manylinux specification that supports additional architectures is `manylinux2014`.


If setting a custom Docker image, you'll need to make sure it can be used in the same way as the official, default Docker images: all necessary Python and pip versions need to be present in `/opt/python/`, and the auditwheel tool needs to be present for cibuildwheel to work. Apart from that, the architecture and relevant shared system libraries need to be compatible to the relevant standard to produce valid manylinux1/manylinux2010/manylinux2014/manylinux_2_24 wheels (see [pypa/manylinux on GitHub](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux), [PEP 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/), [PEP 571](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/), [PEP 599](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) and [PEP 600](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/) for more details).

Auditwheel detects the version of the manylinux standard in the Docker image through the `AUDITWHEEL_PLAT` environment variable, as cibuildwheel has no way of detecting the correct `--plat` command line argument to pass to auditwheel for a custom image. If a Docker image does not correctly set this `AUDITWHEEL_PLAT` environment variable, the `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` option can be used to do so (e.g., `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT='AUDITWHEEL_PLAT="manylinux2010_$(uname -m)"'`).

#### Examples

    ```

    Like any other option, these can be placed in `[tool.cibuildwheel.linux]`
    if you perfer; they have no effect on `macos` and `windows`.

### `CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS` {: #dependency-versions}
> Specify how cibuildwheel controls the versions of the tools it uses

Options: `pinned` `latest` `<your constraints file>`

Default: `pinned`

If `CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS` is `pinned`, cibuildwheel uses versions of tools
like `pip`, `setuptools`, `virtualenv` that were pinned with that release of
cibuildwheel. This represents a known-good set of dependencies, and is
recommended for build repeatability.

If set to `latest`, cibuildwheel will use the latest of these packages that
are available on PyPI. This might be preferable if these packages have bug
fixes that can't wait for a new cibuildwheel release.

To control the versions of dependencies yourself, you can supply a [pip
constraints](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files) file
here and it will be used instead.

!!! note
    If you need different dependencies for each python version, provide them
    in the same folder with a `-pythonXY` suffix. e.g. if your
    `CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS=./constraints.txt`, cibuildwheel will use
    `./constraints-python37.txt` on Python 3.7, or fallback to
    `./constraints.txt` if that's not found.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS_MACOS` | `CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS_WINDOWS`

!!! note
    This option does not affect the tools used on the Linux build - those versions
    are bundled with the manylinux image that cibuildwheel uses. To change
    dependency versions on Linux, use the [CIBW_MANYLINUX_*](#manylinux-image)
    options.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Use tools versions that are bundled with cibuildwheel (this is the default)
    CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS: pinned

    # Use the latest versions available on PyPI
    CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS: latest

    # Use your own pip constraints file
    CIBW_DEPENDENCY_VERSIONS: ./constraints.txt
    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Use tools versions that are bundled with cibuildwheel (this is the default)
    dependency-versions = "pinned"

    # Use the latest versions available on PyPI
    dependency-versions = "latest"

    # Use your own pip constraints file
    dependency-versions = "./constraints.txt"
    ```

## Testing

### `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND` {: #test-command}
> Execute a shell command to test each built wheel

Shell command to run tests after the build. The wheel will be installed
automatically and available for import from the tests. To ensure the wheel is
imported by your tests (instead of your source copy), **tests are not run from
your project directory**. Use the placeholders `{project}` and `{package}` when
specifying paths in your project. If this variable is not set, your wheel will
not be installed after building.

- `{project}` is an absolute path to the project root - the working directory
  where cibuildwheel was called.
- `{package}` is the path to the package being built - the `package_dir`
  argument supplied to cibuildwheel on the command line.

The command is run in a shell, so you can write things like `cmd1 && cmd2`.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Run the project tests against the installed wheel using `nose`
    CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: nosetests {project}/tests

    # Run the package tests using `pytest`
    CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: pytest {package}/tests

    # Trigger an install of the package, but run nothing of note
    CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "echo Wheel installed"
    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Run the project tests against the installed wheel using `nose`
    test-command = "nosetests {project}/tests"

    # Run the package tests using `pytest`
    test-command = "pytest {package}/tests"

    # Trigger an install of the package, but run nothing of note
    test-command = "echo Wheel installed"
    ```

    In configuration files, you can use an array, and the items will be joined with `&&`.


### `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST` {: #before-test}
> Execute a shell command before testing each wheel

A shell command to run in **each** test virtual environment, before your wheel is installed and tested. This is useful if you need to install a non-pip package, invoke pip with different environment variables,
or perform a multi-step pip installation (e.g. installing scikit-build or Cython before installing test package).

The active Python binary can be accessed using `python`, and pip with `pip`; cibuildwheel makes sure the right version of Python and pip will be executed. The placeholder `{package}` can be used here; it will be replaced by the path to the package being built by cibuildwheel.

The command is run in a shell, so you can write things like `cmd1 && cmd2`.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
 `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST_MACOS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BEFORE_TEST_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Install test dependencies with overwritten environment variables.
    CIBW_BEFORE_TEST: CC=gcc CXX=g++ pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install non pip python package
    CIBW_BEFORE_TEST: cd some_dir; ./configure; make; make install

    # Install python packages that are required to install test dependencies

    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml

    # Install test dependencies with overwritten environment variables.
    before-test = "CC=gcc CXX=g++ pip install -r requirements.txt"

    # Chain commands using && or using an array
    before-test = "rm -rf ./data/cache && mkdir -p ./data/cache"
    before-test = [
        "rm -rf ./data/cache",
        "mkdir -p ./data/cache",
    ]

    # Install non pip python package
    before-test = [
        "cd some_dir",
        "./configure",
        "make",
        "make install",
    ]

    # Install python packages that are required to install test dependencies
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    before-test = "pip install cmake scikit-build"
    ```

    In configuration files, you can use an array, and the items will be joined with `&&`.


### `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES` {: #test-requires}
> Install Python dependencies before running the tests

Space-separated list of dependencies required for running the tests.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Install pytest before running CIBW_TEST_COMMAND
    CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: pytest

    # Install specific versions of test dependencies
    CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: nose==1.3.7 moto==0.4.31
    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    # Install pytest before running CIBW_TEST_COMMAND
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    test-requires = "pytest"

    # Install specific versions of test dependencies
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    test-requires = ["nose==1.3.7", "moto==0.4.31"]
    ```

    In configuration files, you can use an array, and the items will be joined with a space.


### `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS` {: #test-extras}
> Install your wheel for testing using `extras_require`

List of
[extras_require](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies)
options that should be included when installing the wheel prior to running the
tests. This can be used to avoid having to redefine test dependencies in
`CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES` if they are already defined in `setup.py` or
`setup.cfg`.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_MACOS` | `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Will cause the wheel to be installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`
    CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS: "test,qt"
    ```

    Seperate multiple items with a comma.

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Will cause the wheel to be installed with `pip install <wheel_file>[test,qt]`
    test-extras: ["test", "qt"]
    ```

    In configuration files, you can use an inline array, and the items will be joined with a comma.

### `CIBW_TEST_SKIP` {: #test-skip}
> Skip running tests on some builds

This will skip testing on any identifiers that match the given skip patterns (see [`CIBW_SKIP`](#build-skip)). This can be used to mask out tests for wheels that have missing dependencies upstream that are slow or hard to build, or to skip slow tests on emulated architectures.

With macOS `universal2` wheels, you can also skip the individual archs inside the wheel using an `:arch` suffix. For example, `cp39-macosx_universal2:x86_64` or `cp39-macosx_universal2:arm64`.

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

    ```yaml
    # Will avoid testing on emulated architectures
    CIBW_TEST_SKIP: "*-manylinux_{aarch64,ppc64le,s390x}"

    # Skip trying to test arm64 builds on Intel Macs
    CIBW_TEST_SKIP: "*-macosx_arm64 *-macosx_universal2:arm64"
    ```

!!! tab examples "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.cibuildwheel]
    # Will avoid testing on emulated architectures
    test-skip = "*-manylinux_{aarch64,ppc64le,s390x}"

    # Skip trying to test arm64 builds on Intel Macs
    test-skip = "*-macosx_arm64 *-macosx_universal2:arm64"
    ```

## Other

### `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY` {: #build-verbosity}
> Increase/decrease the output of pip wheel

An number from 1 to 3 to increase the level of verbosity (corresponding to invoking pip with `-v`, `-vv`, and `-vvv`), between -1 and -3 (`-q`, `-qq`, and `-qqq`), or just 0 (default verbosity). These flags are useful while debugging a build when the output of the actual build invoked by `pip wheel` is required.

Platform-specific environment variables are also available:<br/>
`CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_MACOS` | `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_WINDOWS` | `CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY_LINUX`

#### Examples

!!! tab examples "Environment variables"

                    [package_dir]

Build wheels for all the platforms.

positional arguments:
  package_dir           Path to the package that you want wheels for. Must be
                        a subdirectory of the working directory. When set,
                        the working directory is still considered the
                        'project' and is copied into the Docker container on
                        Linux. Default: the working directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --platform {auto,linux,macos,windows}
                        Platform to build for. For "linux" you need docker
                        running, on Mac or Linux. For "macos", you need a Mac
                        machine, and note that this script is going to
                        automatically install MacPython on your system, so
                        don't run on your development machine. For "windows",
                        you need to run in Windows, and it will build and
                        test for all versions of Python. Default: auto.
  --archs ARCHS         Comma-separated list of CPU architectures to build
                        for. When set to 'auto', builds the architectures

                        to build an architecture via emulation, for example,
                        using binfmt_misc and QEMU. Default: auto. Choices:
                        auto, auto64, auto32, native, all, x86_64, i686,
                        aarch64, ppc64le, s390x, universal2, arm64, x86,
                        AMD64
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Destination folder for the wheels.
  --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        TOML config file for cibuildwheel; usually
                        pyproject.toml, but can be overridden with this
                        option. Use {package} for the package directory
  --print-build-identifiers
                        Print the build identifiers matched by the current
                        invocation and exit.
  --allow-empty         Do not report an error code if the build does not
                        match any wheels.
  --prerelease-pythons  Enable pre-release Python versions if available.

Most options are supplied via environment variables or in --config-file
(pyproject.toml usually). See https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel#options
for info.
